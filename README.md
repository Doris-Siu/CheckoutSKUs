## Opening in Visual Studio
Prerequisites:
- Follow the steps [here](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/BuildFromSource.md) to set up a local copy of dotnet
- Visual Studio 2017 15.7 latest preview - [download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?ch=pre&sku=Enterprise&rel=15)

We recommend getting the latest preview version of Visual Studio and updating it frequently. The Blazor editing experience in Visual Studio depends on new features of the Razor language tooling and will be updated frequently.

When installing Visual Studio choose the following workloads:

- ASP.NET and Web Development
- Visual Studio extension development features

If you have problems using Visual Studio with Blazor.sln please refer to the [developer documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/BuildFromSource.md).
